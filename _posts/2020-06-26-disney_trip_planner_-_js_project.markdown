I’ll say, this project was definitely the funnest project so far! I actually started working on it the Thursday before project week because I wanted to jump into writing my own Javascript as soon as possible. I quickly got my base HTML, models, and controllers layed out, then I started configuring my JS events. It was super fun to figure out different ways to manipulate the DOM, submit forms through JS, and the like!

My project is a Disney trip planner. Basically, it allows you to build a trip to Disney, add days to it, and make plans for each day. For example, you could make a plan to go to Casey’s Corner at Magic Kingdom for lunch, or schedule a FastPass for Peter Pan’s Flight in the evening, or any combination of restaurants and/or attractions! Also, you can load and view previously made trips.

I really enjoy the freedom Javascript gives you to solve a problem in many different ways, in stark contrast to the convention-oriented experience of Ruby. However, it is a bit of a double-edged sword: On one hand, if you aren’t comfortable with Javascript, the quirks and strange rules can make it more error-prone, and difficult to debug. But, if you learn to love the quirks and nuances of Javascript, and embrace them, it can be VERY powerful. I think JavaScript is awesome, and I can’t wait to learn more!
