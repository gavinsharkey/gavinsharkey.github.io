So, my family and I have a problem that probably isn’t unique to us. We’ll sit down to find a movie to watch, and will find ourselves endlessly scrolling through Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc. unable to pick a movie that we all want to watch.
It was getting ridiculous.

So we came up with a solution: we all write down the movies we want to watch, and we put them in a jar. When it comes time to watch a movie, we draw a movie from that jar and we watch it. Period.

When we came up with this solution, my first thought was *‘This is so simple, there should be an app for this’*. So when it came time to make my Sinatra project, I decided to make that my project.

This app allows a user to make jars and put movies in those jars. A user can then ‘draw’ a random movie from a jar (just like real life!). Also, to stick to RESTful conventions, users can edit the contents of their jars, as well as the movies in their jars. And users can delete their jars.

This project was really fun to make! Following the conventions outlined by the curriculum really helped me get this project started quickly. Having things like REStful routes and ActiveRecord make configuring the base functionality pretty easy. Adding my custom features was a little more complicated. It was a balancing act between sticking to convention and getting the feature to work. I also attempted to style it a little bit with CSS. I’m definitely not an artist, but I think it looks alright XD. I’m happy with how it turned out.
