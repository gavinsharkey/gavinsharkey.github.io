Now I'll be honest, this project was a lot harder than the first two XD. While making this project, there were many times where I didn’t feel confident with my knowledge, for one reason or another. Like, I knew what I was doing, and how to do what I needed to do for my app, but I just didn’t feel as confident. But now that my app is pretty much done (except for some cosmetic stuff), I feel much better about it; it definitely came together in the end.

My app allows you to create workouts with various different exercises, but also allows you to view other users’ workouts, comment on them, and even save them! After you sign up (manually or through Facebook), you’ll be greeted with a list of many workouts from users. You can look through these, and save one if it’s really good. Or, you can go to your profile and make your own workout. Whether it's your chest day routine, a leg day finisher, or a hella sick ab workout, you can make it!

While I’m happy with how this turned out, I feel like I definitely could have managed my time better. The weekend leading up to project week I found myself getting nervous about it, which made me not want to work on it. Which is so dumb because **not working on it isn’t gonna help your situation buddy!** But whatevs, it was still fun to make ^_^.
