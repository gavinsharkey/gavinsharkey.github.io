Oh boy, it’s my final project! It’s really crazy to look back and realize how far I’ve come; it wasn’t too long ago that I was only making little CLI programs in Ruby and Python. For this project, I set out to make something that I felt was at the very edge of my capabilities. And now that I’m pretty much done with it, I can say that I’m very pleased with what I was able to accomplish, but it also wasn’t as hard as I thought it was going to be. 

My project is a twitter-esque social media that I call Nibbl. The quirk of this app is that there’s a 30-character limit on posts, so you have to be extra concise. The feature set is pretty simple, but you have most of the basic social media features: You can follow users, and like and comment on their posts. You can search for users. Users are recommended to you. And you can edit your profile.

There were definitely aspects of developing this app that were… interesting. For one, I ended up using Redux for pretty much all of the state of my app (save for like controlled forms, obviously). At first I felt like this was major overkill, as most of my reducers were isolated to one component and its direct children. But I ended up really getting into a flow with writing reducers, and I appreciated the flexibility Redux offered for attaching state to components.

Also, even though this is the React project, I found myself learning a lot of new things about Rails as well. Firstly, I had to figure out authentication and storing cookies over an API, which wasn’t too difficult but a fun challenge nonetheless. I also learned a lot more about the ActiveRecord query interface, as I had to do some pretty complex SQL queries to get the data properly formatted for my frontend.

I think my biggest takeaway from this project is that I’m more capable than I think I am, and that, If I put the work in, I can do anything I put my mind to. After this project, I’m excited to get started on new React projects, as well as expanding my knowledge to things like React Native and so on. I’ve learned so much in the past 5 months, but honestly... my education is only just getting started!
