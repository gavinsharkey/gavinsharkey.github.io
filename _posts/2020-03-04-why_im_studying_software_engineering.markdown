My interests have always varied between the creative and the technical. Growing up homeschooled, I sought out creative outlets such as photography, graphic design, and even some web design. However, I also had a fascination for the logic and problem solving nature of Algebra. It was only recently that I found a beautiful blend of creative expression and logic in software engineering and programming. And I fell in love with it.

I dabbled in many forms of art and creativity in my teens. At 13, I taught myself Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, which inspired an interest in graphic design. Later, I became very passionate about photography, going as far as to consider making it a career. I shot events, concerts, landscapes, and the like. I loved thinking about shot composition, and how the color scheme affected the emotion of the shot.

However, it was around the same time that I taught myself mathematics, and more specifically, Algebra. I was fascinated by its logic and abstractness. I remember my first time learning about Systems of Equations, and being amazed at how you could represent real world problems as abstract variables, and manipulate them in a certain way to find an answer. To this day I find the abstract beauty and logic of Algebra to be amazing.

It was around the summer of last year when I started to study programming. I started by learning simple Python logic, and continued on to learn the basics of Object Oriented Programming and some GUI stuff. I was immediately enthralled. I found programming to be the perfect blend of logic and art; itâ€™s a medium with strict, logical rules and abstraction-akin to Algebra-that allows you to make, what is in my opinion, art. It was from this passion that I decided to start studying software engineering.

In conclusion, I'm studying software engineering because it pleases my desire for creativity, as well as my love for logic and problem-solving.
